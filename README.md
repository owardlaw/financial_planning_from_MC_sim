# financial_planning_from_MC_sim
An application for analyzing portfolios based on Monte Carlo simulation over a given period of time. Also, uses the Alpaca API to gather historical and current market data. 


## Technologies

This project leverages python 3.7 with the following packages:

* [dotenv](https://pypi.org/project/python-dotenv/) - For safely storing API keys in a .env.

* [pandas](https://github.com/pandas-dev/pandas) - For organizing data.

* [alpaca-trade-api](https://pypi.org/project/alpaca-trade-api/) - To gather historical and current market data. 

* [jupyterlab](https://jupyter.org/install.html) - To visualize the code in a modular format. 

* [forecast-tools](https://pypi.org/project/forecast-tools/) - For to run Monete Carlo simulations.
